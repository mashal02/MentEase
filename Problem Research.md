# Problem Research Document: Connecting Mentees with Mentors 
## Introduction:  
In a world driven by constant innovation, mentorship stands as a guiding force for personal and professional development. However, the process of connecting mentors with mentees faces significant challenges especially when it comes to finding the right mentor who can guide one as per their requirements. By understanding these problems faced by mentees in searching and connecting to mentors, we aim to make a platform that seamlessly connects mentees seeking guidance with experienced mentors.  

## Problem Statement:  
The first challenge that individuals looking to gain mentorship is connecting with someone from a similar domain, and someone who has went through the same path. One may search folks from his/her company or organization on LinkedIn but one can’t instantly know if they’d be open to mentoring or not. So a platform where mentors sign up means that they are open to connecting with potential mentees and that provides ease in connecting with such people.
